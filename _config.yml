# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values

# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I am a data-driven problem solver with a strong foundation in data engineering and data science, intentionally evolving into Machine Learning Engineering. I design reliable data pipelines, transform raw data into meaningful insights, and build scalable systems that power intelligent decision-making. My work sits at the intersection of data, software, and applied machine learning—where models are not just trained, but deployed, monitored, and improved in real-world environments.

I am deeply interested in turning complex datasets into production-ready solutions using Python, SQL, cloud-native tools, and modern ML frameworks. Beyond technical execution, I value clarity, reproducibility, and impact, ensuring every model or pipeline delivers measurable value. This space documents my learning journey, projects, experiments, and engineering mindset as I transition fully into Machine Learning Engineering, building systems that learn, adapt, and scale with purpose.
